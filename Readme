Aldrich, Suzanne	aigeanta@cs.stanford.eduComment:Essay:	When the striped squirrel receives the Squirrel::Food() message, it evaluates Squirrel::GetNervousness() and invokes Squirrel::SetNervousness(). Then Squirrel::TreeProbability() is evaluated, and since the critter is really nervous, Striped::Tree() is invoked.  Since ignoreTree is false, Squirrel::Tree() is invoked, which in turn causes Squirrel::GetNervousness() to be evaluated and Squirrel::SetNervousness() to be invoked
